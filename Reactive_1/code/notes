how to use maven:
    mvn compile exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="bgu.atd.a1.sim.Simulator"

1. should we stop thread in the middle of a task or just prevent submitting more task to pool
2. if I need to parse the json in start how do i know how many threads to have in the pool?
3. I added pool as protected variable in Action, how it will work if the replace the pool implementation with their implementation?

1.should we check prequisites with grade greater than 56? 
2.ActorThreadpool uses ActorThread, they might change to their ActorThreadpool, is it ok?
3.in sendmessage, should we always send new privatestate? 
4.action.handle() execute the action only once?  

Error I had:
